    <h2 class="page-title gradient-text">About</h2>
    <p class="page-subtitle">
      Engineer. Systems thinker. Calm problem solver.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m an IT professional and software developer who works at the intersection
      of <strong>systems, reliability, and people</strong>.
      My focus is not just building software — but making sure systems actually
      work, scale, and stay dependable in real environments.
    </p>

    <p>
      I currently work at the <strong>American School of Bombay</strong> as an
      IT Support and Systems Solutions Developer, supporting and maintaining
      mission-critical infrastructure used daily across the organization.

  <!-- WHAT I DO -->
  <section class="reveal">
    <h3>What I Do</h3>

    <p>
      My role blends development, system administration, and ownership.
      I build internal tools, manage platforms, and ensure technology quietly
      supports people instead of getting in their way.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Develop and maintain applications using Java, JSP, Python, and SQL</li>
      <li>Manage Google Admin, O365, Cisco Meraki, Veracross, Printix, and Schoology</li>
      <li>Automate repetitive IT workflows to reduce errors and manual effort</li>
      <li>Troubleshoot infrastructure with a systems-first mindset</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- HOW I THINK -->
  <section class="reveal">
    <h3>How I Think</h3>

    <p>
      I believe consistency beats intensity.
      Systems don’t reward bursts of effort — they reward reliability,
      clarity, and responsibility.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whether it’s infrastructure, software, or teams,
      my approach is always the same:
      understand the system, remove friction,
      and make it resilient.
    </p>

  <!-- BACKGROUND -->
  <section class="reveal">
    <h3>Background</h3>

    <p>
      I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Applications and a Bachelor’s degree
      in Computer Science. Alongside my professional work, I’ve built projects
      ranging from web platforms to mobile applications and regularly mentor
      students through community tech workshops.
    </p>

  <!-- NOW -->
  <section class="reveal">
    <h3>Now</h3>

    <p>
      Currently focused on maintaining reliable internal systems,
      improving IT automation at scale,
      and writing about discipline, systems thinking,
      and real-world technology.

  <!-- WORKING WITH ME -->
  <section class="hire reveal">
    <h3>Working With Me</h3>

    <p>
      I’m comfortable owning systems end-to-end —
      from understanding the problem
      to delivering stable, maintainable solutions.
    </p>

    <p class="muted">
      If you’re building systems that need to be reliable —
      not just impressive — I’d love to talk.

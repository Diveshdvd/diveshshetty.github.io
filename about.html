  <h2 class="page-title">About</h2>
  <p class="page-subtitle">
    Engineer. Systems thinker. Calm problem solver.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m an IT professional and software developer who works at the intersection
    of <strong>systems, reliability, and people</strong>.
    My focus is not just building software — but making sure systems actually
    work, scale, and stay dependable in real environments.
  </p>

  <p>
    I currently work at the <strong>American School of Bombay</strong> as an
    IT Support and Systems Solutions Developer, supporting and maintaining
    mission-critical infrastructure used daily across the organization.
  </p>

  <h3>What I Do</h3>
  <p>
    My role blends development, system administration, and ownership.
    I build internal tools, manage platforms, and ensure technology quietly
    supports people instead of getting in their way.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Develop and maintain applications using Java, JSP, Python, and SQL</li>
    <li>Manage Google Admin, O365, Cisco Meraki, Veracross, Printix, and Schoology</li>
    <li>Automate repetitive IT workflows to reduce errors and manual effort</li>
    <li>Troubleshoot infrastructure with a systems-first mindset</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="divider"></div>

  <h3>How I Think</h3>
  <p>
    I believe consistency beats intensity.
    Systems don’t reward bursts of effort — they reward reliability,
    clarity, and responsibility.
  </p>

  <p>
    Whether it’s infrastructure, software, or teams,
    my approach is always the same:
    understand the system, remove friction,
    and make it resilient.
  </p>

  <div class="divider"></div>

  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p>
    I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Applications and a Bachelor’s degree
    in Computer Science. Alongside my professional work, I’ve built projects
    ranging from web platforms to mobile applications and regularly mentor
    students through community tech workshops.
  </p>

  <div class="divider"></div>

  <h3>Now</h3>
  <p>
    Currently focused on maintaining reliable internal systems,
    improving IT automation at scale,
    and writing about discipline, systems thinking,
    and real-world technology.

    <h3>Working With Me</h3>
    <p>
      I’m comfortable owning systems end-to-end —
      from understanding the problem
      to delivering stable, maintainable solutions.
    </p>

    <p class="muted">
      If you’re building systems that need to be reliable —
      not just impressive — I’d love to talk.

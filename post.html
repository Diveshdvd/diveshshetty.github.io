    <h2>Virat Kohli and the Discipline of Showing Up</h2>
    <div class="meta">Cricket · Mindset · Inspiration</div>

    <img src="kohli.jpg" alt="Virat Kohli batting">

    <p>
      Virat Kohli’s journey was never about talent alone. Talent gets noticed,
      but discipline is what sustains greatness. Watching his career unfold
      over the years felt like observing a masterclass in accountability.
    </p>

    <p>
      There were phases where runs did not come, critics were relentless,
      and self-doubt was visible. Yet, what separated Kohli from many others
      was his refusal to disappear. He showed up — every day, every series,
      every match.
    </p>

    <p>
      That lesson translated directly into my own professional life. In
      technology, consistency matters more than brilliance. Systems don’t
      reward intensity; they reward reliability.

    <h2>Mumbai: Chaos, Dreams, and Quiet Lessons</h2>
    <div class="meta">City · Life · Growth</div>

    <img src="mumbai.jpg" alt="Mumbai city street">

    <p>
      Mumbai is not gentle. It does not wait, and it does not apologize.
      The city teaches resilience through experience, not advice.
    </p>

    <p>
      Local trains, endless crowds, monsoons, and ambition packed into
      narrow streets — Mumbai forces you to adapt. You learn patience,
      urgency, and humility at the same time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Living and working here shaped my understanding of systems. In many
      ways, Mumbai itself is a distributed system — chaotic on the surface,
      but remarkably resilient underneath.

    <h2>Politics, Power, and Responsibility</h2>
    <div class="meta">Politics · Society · Thought</div>

    <img src="politics.jpg" alt="Abstract representation of politics and power">

    <p>
      Politics today is louder than ever, yet clarity feels rare. In a digital
      world, influence spreads faster than responsibility.
    </p>

    <p>
      What concerns me is not disagreement, but misinformation. Technology
      amplifies voices, but it also amplifies consequences. With reach must
      come accountability.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whether in leadership, governance, or systems design, the principle
      remains the same — power without responsibility eventually fails.

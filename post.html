    <h2>Virat Kohli and the Discipline of Showing Up</h2>
    <div class="meta">Cricket · Mindset · Inspiration</div>

    <img src="kohli.jpg" alt="Virat Kohli batting">

    <p>
      I never planned on writing about cricket on my personal website. But some people influence you beyond their field, and Virat Kohli is one of those people for me.
      What inspires me about Kohli isn’t the trophies or the numbers everyone already knows. It’s the discipline behind them. The kind that shows up quietly, daily, without needing applause.
      There was a time when his form dipped. For someone who had spent years dominating, that phase felt uncomfortable to watch. The noise got louder, opinions got sharper, and expectations didn’t ease up. 
      What stood out to me was how he responded not with excuses, not with shortcuts, but with consistency.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my own work—building systems, writing code, solving problems—there are days when progress feels invisible. Things break. Solutions don’t come instantly. Motivation drops. Earlier, I used to wait for the “right mood” to work properly. Now I know better.
Kohli’s journey taught me that professionals don’t wait for motivation; they rely on discipline.
You sit down and do the work.
You fix what’s broken.
You improve one small thing at a time.
Not because it’s exciting, but because it’s necessary.
    </p>

    <p>
      That’s the quiet inspiration Virat Kohli gave me. And it’s one I try to live by, every single day.

    <h2>Mumbai: Chaos, Dreams, and Quiet Lessons</h2>
    <div class="meta">City · Life · Growth</div>

    <img src="mumbai.jpg" alt="Mumbai city street">

    <p>
      Mumbai is not gentle. It does not wait, and it does not apologize.
      The city teaches resilience through experience, not advice.
    </p>

    <p>
      Local trains, endless crowds, monsoons, and ambition packed into
      narrow streets — Mumbai forces you to adapt. You learn patience,
      urgency, and humility at the same time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Living and working here shaped my understanding of systems. In many
      ways, Mumbai itself is a distributed system — chaotic on the surface,
      but remarkably resilient underneath.

    <h2>Politics, Power, and Responsibility</h2>
    <div class="meta">Politics · Society · Thought</div>

    <img src="politics.jpg" alt="Abstract representation of politics and power">

    <p>
      Politics today is louder than ever, yet clarity feels rare. In a digital
      world, influence spreads faster than responsibility.
    </p>

    <p>
      What concerns me is not disagreement, but misinformation. Technology
      amplifies voices, but it also amplifies consequences. With reach must
      come accountability.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whether in leadership, governance, or systems design, the principle
      remains the same — power without responsibility eventually fails.
